A simple CMS blog project using laravel and jquery.js library

Here is my first project a blog using Laravel framework and jquery.js library. It is a blog that users can publish a post using media files like images and videos, edit, update, delete and also share a post via different platforms like facebook , linkedin, whatsapp and twitter. It alse conatins a comment and reply system to allow users to leave their feedback obout a post. I still develop it.

tip: In this blog i wrote a workaround for summernote editor plugin to delete images from the server
when user deletes an image from the editor using Backspace or delete keys. You will find it in my update action in postController in this project

you will find it at the issues section at:  summernote/summernote account 
problem title:  'onMediaDelete not called in all applicable contexts #1242'
Here is problem link: https://github.com/summernote/summernote/issues/1242
